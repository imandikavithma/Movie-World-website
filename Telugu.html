                Vijay Deverakonda as Govardhan and Mrunal Thakur as Indu. Govardhan, an architect from a middle-class background, 
                shoulders the responsibility of supporting his extended family. His life takes a turn when Indu, a university student, 
                becomes a tenant in his home. Their budding relationship faces turmoil upon Govardhan discovering that Indu's closeness 
                was part of her academic thesis on his family, leading to conflict and emotional upheaval. The narrative explores
