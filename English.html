                ​Beauty and the Beast (2017) is a live-action musical romantic fantasy film directed by Bill Condon.
                A remake of Disney's 1991 animated classic, it stars Emma Watson as Belle, a bright and independent
                young woman, and Dan Stevens as the Beast, a prince cursed to live as a monstrous creature.
                The story follows Belle as she becomes a prisoner in the Beast's enchanted castle, where she
                befriends the castle's magical staff and looks beyond the Beast's exterior to discover the kind
                heart within. The film features iconic songs from the original, along with new compositions by
                Alan Menken and Tim Rice, and explores themes of love, redemption, and the transformative power of kindness.

                Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001) is a family comedy directed by Steve Carr and stars Eddie Murphy 
                as Dr. John Dolittle, a veterinarian who can communicate with animals. In this sequel,

                Dolittle must teach Bruno how to survive in the wilderness and woo Ava, all within a tight 
                deadline to prevent the forest's demolition.
