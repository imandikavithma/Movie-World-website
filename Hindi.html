                PK (2014) is a Hindi-language science fiction comedy-drama directed by Rajkumar Hirani.
                The film stars Aamir Khan as an alien who arrives on Earth and loses the device 
                that allows him to communicate with his spaceship. His innocent and childlike questions
                about human behavior, particularly concerning religion and societal norms, challenge the
                status quo and provoke thought among those he encounters. Anushka Sharma co-stars 
                as Jagat "Jaggu" Janani, a journalist who assists PK in his quest. The film satirizes 
                religious dogma and superstitions, encouraging viewers to reflect on the true essence of faith.
